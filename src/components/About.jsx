                As Dynamic Full Stack Developer, I bring a wealth of experience 
                in creating innovative, scalable web and mobile applications using 
                a diverse range of technology. I am proficient in both front-end
                and back-end development, specializing in modern frameworks like
                React, Express, .Net Core, and Spring boot.

                I have a string foundation in sotware engineering principles, gained 
                through hands-on experience in designing responsive user interfaces,
                developing RESTful APIs, optimizing system perfomances, and integrating
                third-party services.

                My passion for technology drives me to continuously learn and adap to 
                emerging trends, contributing to effective, efficient, and innovative
                solutions. I am fluent in English, Zulu, Africans, Sesotho, and I thrive
                in collaborative environments where problem-solving, continuous learning,
                and high-impact development are at the forefront.
